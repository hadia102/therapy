      <<h3>Therapy Corner</h3>
<p>
I have a few thoughts and tips I wanted to share with you all.
<li>
<p>
  <ul>Changing your opinion based on new info is actually how things should work. That is how adults function.</ul>
<ul>Don’t be disrespectful when something does not go your way. There are ways of being respected and heard without being rude.</ul>
<ul>When speaking about the hardships of one group of people, do not bring up other groups. You are undermining the importance of the voices of the first group.</ul>
<ul>Try to gather info without sounding ignorant, try googling things!</ul>
<ul>Do not make fun of people’s interests. Whether it be their music taste, how they dress, and everything that they like. As long as it does not hurt anybody, they should be respected for their likes.</ul>
<ul>Be as open minded as possible! Just because you did not experience it does not mean other people do not.</ul>
<ul>Stop pointing out things about people they can not control, this includes: scars, cellulite, body hair, extra skin, loose skin, tummy rolls, stretch marks, self harm scars, dark underarms, acne, weight, crooked/yellow teeth, eczema/rashes. None of these makes a person ugly. You are only ugly if your ugly inside.</ul>
<ul>Take advantage of whatever power you have to help the powerless.</ul>
<ul>Let women wear whatever they want, no one cares for your judgement. This includes covering up completely or not covering at all.</ul>
<ul>No one needs your judgement and try your best not to assume anything. This may lead to misunderstanding.</ul>
<ul>Live your life in moderation. Balance is key!!</ul>
<div class = "list">
  <ul> <p class = "header">Feminism is about empowering women not hating men, however not everything we do must accommodate to men, as long as we are not hurting them.</p>

    <li class="item">The whole point is not kiss men’s ass but they do have their issues that we must help with</li>
    <li class="item">It's about prioritizing women over men because it has been the opposite since the beginning of time. If men perceives that as hate, then that is their own problem.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<ul>Men’s emotions are seen to be objective logic and reason and anyone who disagrees is being irrational (feminists).</ul>
<ul>Asians are so underrepresented in the media, let's change that shall we?</ul>
<ul>Im talking south asians too btw we’re also asians.</ul>
<ul>There are way too many hate crimes focused on us, but we are not given the proper attention because it is easy targeting asians.</ul>
<ul>Low income people are punished too severely for their small crimes while high income ones are barely punished for their crimes against humanity.</ul>
<ul>Men need to accept rejection and accept a woman’s right to say no.</ul>
<ul>CONSENT IS ALWAYS NECESSARY.</ul>
<ul>Cancel culture needs to be canceled.</ul>
<ul>Everyone makes mistakes and they always deserve a second chance to learn and change for the better. We need to stop expecting perfection because we will never get it. We need to allow our society to grow and learn from their actions. There are exceptions to this of course.</ul>
<ul>Every woman should have the right to an abortion. They must have the right to decide what every they want to do with their body. It is no one else’s business</ul>
<ul>Rape should NEVER be excused. IT IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE.</ul>
<ul>Finding people who keep up with politics “annoying” shows how privileged you are to not have to worry about that. Or it demonstrates your fear of the world because you are too scared to learn. (Hadia calm down come back and word this nicer)</ul>
<ul>Media coverage is a huge issue, there are way too much bias.</ul>
<ul>Do not shame people for not living their life the way you want them too. Thank them for trying and i thank you for trying your best to help the world.</ul>
<ul>Illness is not something to be ashamed of.</ul>
<ul>Do not write away a teenager’s mental illness just because they are teenagers and are hormonal.</ul>
<ul>Do not dismiss a women’s mental illness as them being too “emotional”</ul>
<ul>Do not tell a man to man up when they are mentally ill.</ul>
<ul>Do not turn the cheek when you see oppression and injustice, it is never too late to help out. If you are silent you are helping the oppressor.</ul>
<ul>At this point, being neutral is not an option. Choose a side and fight for ur own and other people’s rights.</ul>
<ul>You are either part of the problem for part of the solution.</ul>
<ul>It is okay to step away from things for your own sanity, but no not avoid things because those are opportunities to learn.</ul>
<ul>Be both pro herbal medicine and pro vaccine. Both help with different things.</ul>
<ul>Men, you should not feel emasculated by feminism. There's more to being a man than oppressing woman,actually oppressing women definitely does NOT make you a man.</ul>
<ul>AWARENESS IS IMPORTANT, DO NOT LOOK DOWN ON IT.</ul>
<ul>Stop mocking people who care about the environment, it does not make you cool to neglect your planet.</ul>
<ul>Do not come at people and their lifestyles.</ul>
<ul>Respect EVERYONE in the Lgbtq+ community. EVERYONE.</ul>
<ul>Everyone and their moms should be respecting everyone’s personal space. No one cares if you're uncomfortable because you weren't allowed to make someone uncomfortable.</ul>
<ul>Do not be an asshole. You aren't being “straight up” or “blunt”, you’re being negative and bitter and no one cares for your opinion.</ul>
<ul>Do not culturally appropriate, culturally appreciate. There is a difference.</ul>
<ul>Islam is not homophobic.</ul>
<ul>Ways you can be an Ally:</ul>
<ul>Understand your privilege</ul>
<ul>Speak up but not over</ul>
<ul>Be aware of how space you take up</ul>
<ul>Know the difference between covert and overt homophobia.</ul>
<ul>Don’t be a performative ally.</ul>
<ul>You will make mistakes, learn to apologize and learn.</ul>
<ul>Take action, make mistakes.</ul>
<ul>Encourage womasplaining hehe.</ul>
<ul>Everything always works out, give yourself and life time.</ul>
<ul>Stop invalidating people’s feelings.</ul>
<ul>Don't ever suppress who you are for people’s comfort. If you must suppress you either have to change those things or take pride in it.</ul>
<ul>Men? Challenge your privilege and hold other men accountable if you wanna be involved in feminism.</ul>
<ul>Surround yourself with people with goals and ambitions.</ul>
<ul>Latino is not hispanic is not spanish</ul>
<ul>You are allowed to change your mind. You are allowed to change, it is encouraged actually.</ul>
</p>
<ol id="name">
  Self care:
 </ol>
 Don't confuse this with skincare, I love skin care but i know that there is a difference. Taking care of yourself is so much more than taking care of your exterior self. I totally encourage cleansing, exfoliating and toning but it's time to do those to ourselves inside. I mean cleanse yourself of all the hate. Exfoliate away the bad habits. Tone yourself to be the best person you can possibly be.
There's always room for improvements. You’re never done.
Take breaks, you’re allowed to
